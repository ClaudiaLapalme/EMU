## Contributing
There are a few ways to contribute:  
- Go look at open issues on GitHub.
- Go review some open PRs.
- Ask the team if anyone needs help with anything.

## Project Structure
 - Assets: this folder holds  anything we create for the game. This includes scenes, prefabs, scripts, etc...
 - ProjectSettings: this folder holds, unsurprisingly, the project wide settings and should be the same for every contributor.

## Contributor Etiquette
Due to the nature of Unity game development, there are a few things to watch out for:
 - Make sure you don't check-in unnecessary files into GitHub.
 - If you make use of some third-party library, make sure the team agrees on its use, and that everyone has access to it. [MANIFEST](./Packages/manifest.json)
 - If you need to test something out, do it in a local scene, and do not check it in to GitHub.
 - Document your code. This can be through comments and docstrings inside scripts, or through a text document.
 - DO create PRs for your changes and ask the team to review them.
 - NEVER EVER merge directly into Master unless you know exactly what you're doing and the team is in agreement.

## Issues
 - We will primarily use the provided functionality of GitHub issues to coordinate the work to be done. If you feel like an Issue is missing information or needs clarification, don't hesitate to change it.
 - If we need a feature, or there's a bug to fix and there is no issue for it, don't hesitate to create one.
 - Finally, don't forget to self-assign and update the status of an issue you pick up.
